# Jeanie's Terraform Practice Guide

## Welcome!
This repository exists to document what I've learned about Terraform and to hopefully provide some helpful tips along the way.  It's aimed at beginners to Terraform.  I'm a software engineer poking my toe into devops waters, and wanted to record things from my perspective. This repository is a personal reference but I hope it can also help you!

## What's included?
I put my guide in the [wiki](https://github.com/rowr111/Terraform-practice-guide/wiki)!  Please check it out.  If anything is broken or you have feedback (be kind, please), let me know. 
Any files used in tutorials can also be found in this repository.

## What's next?
This wiki/repo is a work in progress! Check back in the future for more content.

Thanks for visiting! <3
